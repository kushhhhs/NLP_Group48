    "## Prediction-Based Word Vectors\n",
    "In this section, we load pre-trained word vectors using the **GloVe** embeddings from the [Stanford NLP paper on GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf). The pre-trained embeddings provide rich semantic information about words based on large text corpora, allowing us to represent words as vectors that capture their meaning and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. **Load GloVe Word Vectors**: We use the GloVe embeddings from the `glove-wiki-gigaword-200` model, which has 200-dimensional vectors for each word.\n",
    "2. **Vocabulary Matching**: We map the words from our corpus to the GloVe vocabulary and extract the corresponding vectors.\n",
    "3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: After obtaining the word vectors, we reduce the dimensionality to visualize the embeddings in 2D space, allowing us to explore word relationships visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an excellent opportunity to explore how pre-trained embeddings like GloVe can be used to improve downstream NLP tasks by providing richer word representations."

    "### Words with multiple meanings\n",
    "Polysemes and homonyms are words that have more than one meaning (see [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) to learn more about the difference between polysemes and homonyms). Your task is to find a word with at least two different meanings such that the top-10 most similar words (according to cosine similarity) contain related words from both meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- \"leaves\" has both the \"go_away\" and \"a_structure_of_a_plant\" meanings in the top 10.\n",
    "- \"scoop\" has both \"handed_waffle_cone\" and \"lowdown\" meanings in the top 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will probably need to try several polysemous or homonymic words before you find one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you discover a word that fits this criterion, state the word and explain the multiple meanings that occur in the top 10. Reflect on why many of the polysemous or homonymic words you tried didn’t work (i.e., why the top-10 most similar words only contain one of the word's meanings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Use the `wv_from_bin.most_similar(word)` function to get the top 10 most similar words. This function ranks all other words in the vocabulary based on their cosine similarity to the given word. For further assistance, you can refer to the [Gensim documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html)."

    "## Our Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a few words that fit the criterion: 'bear', 'lie', 'break', and 'light. We will elaborate on the last word: 'light'. The top-10 most similar words are shown above. The word 'light' is often used in two types of context: 1) when something is light in weight (i.e. it is not heavy), 2) when something is light visually (i.e. it is not dark, it is bright). These different context are clearly shown in the top-10 words: it contains both words like 'bright', 'dark' and 'sunlight', as well as the word 'heavy'. The reason that many polysemous or homonymic words did not work is likely because many of these words have one meaning/context that is very prominent in the data, which will therefore dominate the top words. Even though the word technically may have multiple meanings, one meaning is dominant in the literature, so the different meanings are not easily learned."

    "The antonyms we found that are closer in cosine distance than related synonyms is shown above: 'large', 'small', and 'big'. \n",
    "\n",
    "A reason why this result may occur is because the word vectors are learned based on very large corpora, by a model learning relationships between words that are often found together in certain contexts. Even though antonyms are by definition complete opposites, for some antonyms it is very likely that they often occur together in text, perhaps even more than a relevant synonym. This will lead to the embeddings of the antonyms being closer in distance than the synonyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our specific antonyms and synonyms: we can imagine that people often talk about something being large when comparing it to something small, therefore mentioning both antonyms in the same context. In addition, when one has already described something is 'large' they may not be inclined to describe it again using a synonym like 'big'. We think this is the most important reason synonyms may be further in distance than antonyms; synonyms may not be used in the same text very often, since people have already said what they needed to say with the first word, why use another word again?"

    "### Bias in word vectors\n",
    "a. **Observation**: Consider the results of a word vector model when queried with analogies involving \"man\", \"woman\", and \"profession\". What are the top results returned by the model for each query?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the analogy man : profession :: woman : x, you get results like 'teaching', 'nursing', 'teacher' at the top.\n",
    "The other way around, woman : profession :: man : x, you get results like 'skill', 'reputation', 'skills', 'business', 'respected' at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **Analysis**: Do you observe any gender biases in the results? For example, are certain professions more closely associated with \"man\" or \"woman\" based on the word vectors? Discuss how word embeddings might perpetuate societal biases present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, clearly there are gender biases: women are generally associated with caretaking jobs, while men are associated with skillful, leadership roles. This is a clear form of historic societal bias, that may be perpetuated if these types of models are used for every day use applications like search machines. You can imagine that people will (perhaps subconsciously) start to associate males and females with different kinds of jobs, if this is what they see on a daily basis when they are searching online.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. **Reflection**: How might such biases affect the fairness of machine learning models that use word embeddings? Suggest potential strategies for mitigating gender bias in word vector models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether this bias is fair depends on the aim of a machine learning model. If a model is build specifically to reflect the current societal situation, then maybe this is exactly what the model should be doing, as society simply may have gender biases. However, if we want a machine learning model that is as unbiased as possible, and fair in any use, then using such embeddings can clearly lead to unfair usecases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to mitigating any type of bias in a model is always to acknowledge it exists. Eventhough in hindsight it often seems extremely obvious, while building these models, the bias often flies under the radar because it is not the intention of the developers. Then, mitigating gender bias in word vector models should mainly focus on the data these embeddings are trained on. If female and males are often mentioned in different contexts in the data, there is not much the model can do to mitigate this; it is simply learning the context of these words. Thus, if we want to mitigate this bias, we need to make sure our data is representative of our final goal. In conclusion; we need to debias our data. For example, by including data where males and females are swapped in their stereotypical roles, like men as nurses or women as leaders."

    "# Final Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Theoretically and in practice, why is it helpful to represent words as vectors? Based on the \n",
    "results you obtained, can you anticipate cases where word vectors would not be helpful to \n",
    "determining a word’s meaning? List 1-2 specific examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is helpful to represent words as vectors because these vectors can capture semantic meaning. They can tell us something about which contexts these words are often used in, and therefore also capture relationships between words and contexts. As we have seen in the assignment, word vectors do struggle in some specific cases. Because each word is simply represented by 1 vector, thus its meaning has to be reduced to 1 vector. One case where this would not be helpful is if a word has multiple very common meanings (like the word 'light' we discussed in the assignment), one vector can then not tell us exactly what the word means.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Describe the two ways of representing words you implement in the notebook. What stands out \n",
    "when comparing these two methods in how they represent words?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    One way is to simply use the frequency of co-occurrences as word-vectors. A word-vector will then be very sparse (many zeros), and only have non-zero values at the indices of words the word has occurred with in the corpus.\n",
    "    Another way is to use learned (pretrained) word vectors like the GLoVE embeddings. This method allows word embeddings to be capture more semantic meaning, instead of just reflecting how often words occur together. \n",
    "    What stands out when comparing these methods is that many words may cluster around 0,0 for the first method. You can see this for words like 'congress', 'congressmen', and 'paid' which are all plotted at 0,0. Additionally, some words that are semantically similar may receive the exact same embedding, even though they are the exact same word. For example, the words 'son' and 'daughter' are expected to be similar, but not equal, however they receive the exact same embedding in the first method. For the second method, these problems are mitigated. Words do not cluster around one point, but form a sort of ellipse in the 2d space. Word like 'daughter' and 'son' here are close together, but not equal, which makes sense. Words like 'policemand' and 'sheriff' that are somewhat similar but still a little different are very far apart for the first method, while for the second method they are relatively close. In general, the second method therefore seems more effective and realistic in representing words as embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The code provides simple examples that could be used to evaluate word vectors. Are these \n",
    "effective evaluations for the meaning of a word? Why or why not? Give at least one concrete \n",
    "example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the code one way we evaluate the meaning of a word is by looking at the top-k most similar words. Even though we saw this may not always work well (e.g. polysemy), I believe this simple evaluation is effective in most cases. In general, I think it is very useful to look at words that are similar in meaning to a word, to find the meaning of that word. For example, if I want to know what the word 'extravagant' means, one of the first steps I would likely take is to go to a search engine and look up the word, the first thing that pops-up is a definition together with related words. This method is thus quite similar to an everyday method many people likely use once in a while."
